# 👋 Hi, I'm Kashad Turner-Warren
🔐 **Machine Learning Engineer in training | Offensive AI Researcher | Mathematics for Security Advocate**

---

## 📖 My Journey
Since mid-2022, I’ve been persistently pursuing opportunities in **security engineering** and **DevOps** with top companies like Choice Hotels, American Express, and Red Hat. After overcoming challenges—including a successful thyroidectomy in August 2023—I made a commitment to invest in myself and define my own path through **AI, cybersecurity, and applied mathematics**.

Rejection turned into redirection. Instead of waiting for the right opportunity, I built it through **projects, learning, and relentless growth**.

---

## 🔍 What I'm Working On
One of the highlights of my journey was leading the **Timesheet Security Assessment**, where I performed threat modeling on enterprise timesheet systems. That experience cemented my passion for securing critical systems.

Now, my focus has expanded to:
- **Adversarial Machine Learning**: Studying how attackers exploit AI systems—and how we can defend against them.
- **Robotics & Automation Security**: Applying AI to secure smart devices and industrial control systems.
- **Mathematics for Security**: Researching how mathematical frameworks can predict, prevent, and counter cyber threats.

---

## 🎓 Current Focus
- Earning my **Bachelor of Science in Mathematics** at **Arizona State University** (Graduating 2026)
- Building machine learning models for **cyber defense** and **automation security**
- Studying **offensive AI tactics** to stay ahead of emerging threats
- Developing projects that combine **ML, cybersecurity, and robotics**
